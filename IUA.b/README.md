# IUA.b work item

## Breaking changes

 * The IHE-JWT Authorization scheme has been replaced by the "Bearer" to be compatible with RFC 6750  
 * Custom claim names have been replaced by an established OpenID claim whenever possible and aligned with the UDAP extensions mechanism 

## Open questions
